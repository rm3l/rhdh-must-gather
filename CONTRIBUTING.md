### Local Development/Testing

#### Testing

```bash

# View all available targets
make help

# Run locally (requires oc, kubectl, jq, yq, and access to a cluster)
make run-local

# Test specific script locally. Examples:
make run-script SCRIPT=helm    # Test only gather_helm
make run-script SCRIPT=operator # Test only gather_operator

# Test in container with local cluster access
make run-container

# Test with OpenShift using oc adm must-gather
make deploy-openshift

# Test on regular Kubernetes (non-OpenShift) by creating a Job in the cluster
make deploy-k8s

# Clean up test artifacts and images
make clean
```

#### Building the Image

```bash
# Build locally
make image-build

# Build and push to registry
make image-push REGISTRY=your-registry.com IMAGE_NAME=namespace/rhdh-must-gather
