# Commit Message Guidelines

## Format

All commit messages must follow the Conventional Commits format:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<trailers>
```

## Structure

### Subject Line
- Use conventional commit format: `<type>(<scope>): <subject>`
- Types: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `docs`, `chore`, `test`, `ci`, etc.
- Keep under 72 characters
- Use imperative mood (e.g., "add" not "added")

### Body (Required)
- **Must include context explaining WHY the change was made**
- Separate from subject with a blank line
- Wrap at 72 characters
- Explain:
  - What problem does this solve?
  - Why is this approach chosen?
  - What are the implications?
  - Any important technical details

### Trailers (Required)
- Must include: `Assisted-by: Cursor`
- Other trailers as needed (e.g., `Co-authored-by`, `Fixes`, etc.)

## Examples

### Good Example

```
feat(ci): add expiry labels to commit-SHA tagged images

Update both PR and release workflows to rebuild and push extra tags
(those with commit SHA) using make build-push instead of simple
docker tag/push. This ensures the quay.expires-after=2w label is
properly applied to ephemeral commit-specific tags.

Main stable tags (next, next-1.x, pr-{number}, and version tags)
remain permanent, while commit-SHA variants (next-{sha}, next-1.x-{sha},
pr-{number}-{sha}) now automatically expire after 2 weeks to reduce
registry clutter.

The rebuild is efficient thanks to Docker's layer caching, as all
layers are already cached from the main tag build.

Assisted-by: Cursor
```

### Bad Example (Missing Context)

```
feat(ci): update workflows

Changed some workflow files.

Assisted-by: Cursor
```

**Why it's bad:** Doesn't explain WHY the change was made or what problem it solves.

## Grouping Commits

- Group related changes logically
- Each commit should be a complete, logical unit
- Don't mix unrelated changes in one commit
- Consider splitting large changes into multiple commits with clear separation of concerns

## Quick Checklist

Before committing, ask:
- [ ] Does the subject line clearly describe WHAT changed?
- [ ] Does the body explain WHY this change was needed?
- [ ] Does the body provide context for future readers?
- [ ] Is the `Assisted-by: Cursor` trailer included?
- [ ] Are changes grouped logically?
- [ ] Would someone reading this commit in 6 months understand the reasoning?
